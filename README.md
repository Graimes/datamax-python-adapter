# Datamax python adapter

This piece of code allows you to control a datamax-o'neil label printer.
You do not need knowledge of the datamax programming language for simple tasks,
this module takes care of it.

The module was developed and tested on python 3.6 using a datamax o'neil e-class
mark III printer.

Still under heavy development.
